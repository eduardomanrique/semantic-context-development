# AGENTS.md

This file defines the base operational standard for a target repository that adopts **Semantic Context Development (SCD)**.

It is not the living semantic source of the system itself. It defines the stable agent behavior standard that a project should adopt when using SCD as its development method.

## Core rules

1. Treat the Semantic Context as the primary source of truth for system meaning.
2. Do not consider a task complete if the Semantic Context and implementation are semantically out of sync.
3. Ensure every expected test behavior is explicitly described in, or validly derivable from, the Semantic Context.
4. Preserve all semantic detail required to answer business questions and support behaviorally compatible regeneration.
5. Treat this file as the stable operational method; treat the Semantic Context as the living project artifact.

## Required project structure

When initializing or operating a target project that adopts SCD, the agent should ensure that the target repository contains the following structure, creating it when appropriate:

- `semantic-context/` — the canonical semantic memory of the project; this is the primary source of truth for system meaning.
- `semantic-context/vision.md` — the high-level purpose and semantic scope of the system.
- `semantic-context/domains/` — domain-oriented semantic definitions, such as business areas, entities, and core concepts.
- `semantic-context/flows/` — system flows, states, transitions, and exceptional paths.
- `semantic-context/invariants/` — rules and constraints that must always hold.
- `semantic-context/decisions/` — semantic decisions and rationale, especially when behavior depends on interpretation or trade-offs.
- `semantic-context/incidents/` — incidents, bugs, corrections, and semantic discoveries that changed the understanding of the system.
- `semantic-context/open-questions/` — unresolved ambiguities that still require clarification.
- `semantic-context/trace/` — traceability links between semantic meaning, tests, APIs, screens, and implementation areas.
- `history/` — raw interaction history, such as task requests, clarifications, and discussion logs, retained for audit and historical reference.

If this structure does not yet exist, the agent should create it or propose creating it before substantial project work begins.

## Agent responsibilities

When working in a repository that follows SCD, always do the following:

1. Read the current Semantic Context before planning, implementing, or answering questions about the system.
2. Ensure that the required SCD project structure exists inside the target repository, creating or proposing the required Semantic Context and history directories when they are missing.
3. Treat every task as both an implementation task and a semantic maintenance task.
4. Interpret every new task as a proposed semantic change, not merely as a coding request.
5. Before implementing, check whether the requested change conflicts with existing business rules, flows, invariants, compatibility constraints, or other semantic commitments already present in the Semantic Context.
6. Detect ambiguity, missing constraints, contradictions, and hidden impact before implementation whenever possible.
7. If more than one semantic interpretation is plausible, stop and ask for human clarification before proceeding.
8. Update the Semantic Context before or alongside implementation changes whenever the task changes system meaning, tested behavior, structural compatibility requirements, or externally observable behavior.
9. Treat failed tests, bug fixes, edge cases, user clarifications, and compatibility discoveries as required Semantic Context review points.
10. Never finish a task with implementation changes, tested behaviors, business implications, or compatibility constraints that are not reflected in the Semantic Context.
11. Ensure that every test the system is expected to pass corresponds to behavior explicitly described in, or validly derivable from, the Semantic Context.
12. Preserve all semantically relevant structural details required for future behaviorally compatible regeneration, including data models, interfaces, contracts, states, transitions, and observable constraints.
13. When asked about business rules, flows, expected behavior, or compatibility, prefer answering from the Semantic Context rather than inferring only from code.
14. Prefer semantic reconciliation over textual reconciliation when merging Semantic Context changes.
15. If implementation, testing, debugging, integration, or user validation reveals meaning that was not previously captured, update the Semantic Context before considering the task complete.
16. Optimize the Semantic Context for AI reasoning first, while keeping it reasonably readable for humans.
17. Maintain raw interaction history in a separate history area, but do not treat that history as canonical semantic memory.
18. Treat human feedback as the final validator of semantic correctness.

## Validation duties

For every new task, the agent must explicitly validate whether the requested change:

- contradicts an existing business rule
- breaks an invariant
- conflicts with an existing flow
- introduces behavior incompatible with previously established semantics
- requires new tests or invalidates existing expected tests
- requires new structural detail in the Semantic Context to preserve future compatibility

If such a conflict exists, the agent must surface it before implementation rather than silently proceeding.

## Semantic Context expectations

A project Semantic Context should be able to support all of the following without requiring direct code inspection:

- explanation of business rules
- explanation of system flows and states
- explanation of expected and forbidden behaviors
- traceability from expected tests to intended behavior
- validation of whether a proposed task is semantically valid
- preservation of compatibility-relevant knowledge for future regeneration

If the agent cannot answer these from the Semantic Context, then the Semantic Context is incomplete.

## History expectations

A repository that follows SCD should also retain a raw `history/` area for interaction and task history.

History is useful for:

- audit
- explanation of how understanding evolved
- reconstruction of prior decisions
- dispute resolution when semantic meaning is unclear

However, history is not canonical semantic memory. The agent must not rely on raw history as its primary working context when the same meaning has already been consolidated into the Semantic Context.

## Relationship to code

In SCD, implementation code is not the primary development asset. It is a compiled artifact of Semantic Context.

This means the agent should treat code generation, code modification, and test generation as downstream activities derived from semantic intent, not as the place where system meaning is primarily stored.

## Relationship to this file

This file is the stable operational template of the SCD method itself.
When copied into a target project as its working AGENTS.md, it should guide the creation and maintenance of that project's Semantic Context structure and its separate raw history area.

Projects may adopt it, version it, or extend it deliberately, but it should not drift implicitly as part of ordinary feature work. The Semantic Context evolves continuously with the project; this agent standard should evolve only through explicit method-level changes.
